            <h1>Nice to Meet You!</h1>
            <p>My name is Mariana Anastácio, and I'm 20 years old, born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal.
                I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Global Design at IADE Creative University.
                While I enjoy working in Graphic Design and Illustration, my true passion lies in 3D Modelling and Animation.
                This interest solidified after I worked on a Character Design project for Overwatch. Since then,
                I've been wanting to dive deeper into the gaming industry.
                <br> <br>
                Outside of my professional life, I'm someone who enjoys painting, cooking, reading, especially thrillers,
                and spending time with the people I love - including my cat Tommy. I've played volleyball for 7 years, but since I
                stopped, I usually go to the gym to stay active. I'm currently learning to play the electric guitar, which has
                been a fun challenge, speacially since I decided to start with <p1>Do I Wanna Know?</p1> from Artic Monkeys. I believe that these passions not only fuel my creativity but also inspire me to bring
                fresh perspectives to everything I work on!</p>
