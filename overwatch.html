                    Overwatch is one of Blizzard Entertainment's most played and popular games.
                    It's a popular team-based multiplayer game, released in 2016, featuring a wide
                    range of heroes and different maps. As for game mechanics, it emphasizes teamwork,
                    strategy, and fast-paced gameplay.

                    This project involves the creation of a 3D character designed for the world of Overwatch,
                    with a focus on aligning the character's aesthetics and abilities with the game's unique style.

                <p>For this project the goal was to create a character with a background story that was involved in
                the Omnic invasion of the Overwatch world. The setting was the Portuguese Tejo River in Lisbon,
                and the character's mission was to defend the TELA Portal located there. Personally, I chose to create
                a Tank Character, íris, acompained by Hidra.</p>

            <div class="right-column">
                <p>Íris is a mythological Tejo Nymph, known in Portuguese sailors' stories. Born and raised in the Tejo River,
                she is the daughter of Zeus and always admired her father's leadership. Skilled in combat, she joined the front
                lines at 15. Despite her peaceful origins, Íris has fought and defeated many enemies. After her sister's death,
                she took charge of her group, vowing to protect her land. Leading since 18, she faced a new challenge during the
                Omnic invasions, forming an alliance with Hydra, a sea serpent, to defeat them. Together, they now protect the
                Tejo and its vital Portal.</p>

                <h2>Íris Character Design</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="right-column">
                <p>Íris was based on the mythological Nyphs, creatures that live in the water and look like humans. Her long white hair is
                a characteristic of those creatures. For her armature, I chose to give her an upper body armature and a seperate one
                for her legs, since she is still a Tank character, even though Hidra exists. For the upper body fabric I chose something
                semi-transperant, since she lives in and out of the water, while also providing flexibility. For the bottom fabric covering
                the legs the concept is the same, although this time it's opaque. The bluish-green on her clothes is often associated with
                the word Nyph. In terms of weaponry, she has “built-in” diamond shape blades on her hands, that she can activate and use
                in a similar way to Eduard Sissor hands.</p>

                Whenever he's needed by his ally, she can summon him and he'll work as a shield. Besides, he can also
                attack the enemies.</p>
