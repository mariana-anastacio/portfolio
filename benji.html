                    This project consisted on the development of a fun character and his environment.
                    It was a great way to play and practice with lights and emission in 3D modelling, trying to create a deep ocean setting.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The animation process was also very interesting trying to make Benji look like he's somewhat swimming in place,
                    while trying to catch a jellyfish. The animal's movements were also a fun challenge in order to look semi-realistic and dynamic.
