                <p>
                    False Identity is a Board Game I created based on teamwork and deception, which can be tricky.
                    My main objective with this game is to help players develop some soft skills like their ability
                    to form relationships with others and their improv thinking skills.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This game was developed entirely from scratch and by hand, except for the cards made with procreate and then printed and cutted.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With this is mind, False Identity is a character based game where you will need to impersonate your
                    character and everyone needs to interact with each other in various unpredictable scenarios.

                <p>False Identity is a game about deception, strategy and improv thinking, all in a character based board
                    game. It's a game for 3 to 10 players (recommended but can be played with less or more), ages 13
                    and up. Each player has a character, that they need to impersonate flawlessly, until the end of the
                    game. <br> <br> You might be a professional assassin, a hippnotherapist, a Japanese chef, a photographer…
                    or, if you don't like any of the suggestions, you can even create your own character! You will navigate
                    the board through your avatar, trying to pass challenges and prove that you are who you're pretending
                    to be in order to win.</p>

            <div class="right-column">
                <p>For the base of my board I decided to go with a simple rectangular shape since it's one of the most
                    popular formats and I figured it would be more harmonious when combined with the other assets. For
                    that, I developed a grid that is rectangular on the sides and circular on the centre, around the
                    cardholders. I wanted to give my board a visual sense of the everyday life of a person, resembling a
                    common everyday place like a street, since, the game takes place in a "small society".</p>

            <div class="right-column">
                <p>On top of the base there are the spots of the game. For this spots, I wanted something that was
                    simple and would quickly communicate to the player the type if situation he would be in if he landed
                    on that spot. For that, I used simplified shapes and symbols that are visually intuitive. I created all of
                    them with the “identity icon” and their base to make the board visually harmonious and aesthetic.</p>

                <p>For the cardholders I decided to maintain the same visuals of the base of the board, maintaining both
                    the colour palette and transforming the spots' icons into actual pieces, that could hold the cards,
                    in an efficient way so that people could take the cards out of the cardholders easily.

                    <p>The cards are divided into various categories, differenciated by colour and symbology. In order
                        to have a coherent design, I used the "identity sybol" of the spots, divided it in half and discreetly
                        placed it, four times making a pattern, in the cover of each card. Some other cards still have the symbol
                        incorporated in a different way.

                    <p>For the pawns, I decided, once more, to use the “identity icon” in order to keep the aesthetic of the
                        game flowing. Besides, the colours are the same as the category cards' ones so the game would have more
                        colour and still be harmonious. For the chips, I decided to decorate them with the previously established pattern in order to visually
                        attach the chips to the rest of the assets.

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="right-column">
                <p>For starters, each player's set consists of 5 Chips, 1 Character Card faced down and 4 Mission
                    Cards, all of them chosen anonymously. You will be the only one aware of your identity in the
                    beginning of the game. Regarding you Mission Cards, you will have to complete them and, each time
                    you do, you get a chip. Only after completing all of your Mission Cards, will you be eligible to win.
                    Roll the dice to determine the order in which the players will take their Character and Mission cards,
                    randomly. The first person to take their cards will also be the first to play, after that person the game
                    follows the normal clock order. The players should assign one of them to be in charge of the chips.
                    This player will make sure everyone gets the chips they deserve throughout the game. But be careful
                    with your choice since this person might try to take some not deserved chips for their own benefit and,
                    in this game, small cheating moves like this are allowed! (As long as 1 round goes by without anyone
                    noticing). <br> <br>
                    Each time someone completes a challenge from one of the solo categories (Watch Out and Finnish
                    The Lyrics) successfully, they receive the number of chips listed on the card of the challenge they just
                    completed. Besides, when a player completes a challenge, that same player is also allowed to ask,
                    any other player they want, a question about their identity. If the player is sure about the opponents
                    identity after the question was made, they can try to guess who the other player is. But careful, if you
                    guess wrongfully, you will need to give one of your chips to the other player but, if you guess correctly
                    the other player will give you one of their chips and turn their Character Card up so everyone can see
                    their identity. Direct questions like “What is you identity?” are not allowed and the player to who the
                    question was asked is not allowed to lie. <br> <br>
                    Throughout the game you will gain and lose chips, make and break alliances and some bad luck
                    might ruin your game. The goal here is to be strategic so you can be the last player standing, that is,
                    the winner.
                    You lose the game if you lose all your chips. Every time a player loses, 1 extra spot of Prove It! Is
                    added to the board on top of a different existing category spot, making the previous spot obsolete.
                    When you lose the game you are not out of the fun! You will now play your part making life harder for
                    those still playing. You will still be able to ask everything you want to the player that landed on the
                    Prove It! spot. Besides, you can complicate the other players game by trading personality traits
                    between them or take chips from the players without them noticing. If you can get through one round
                    without them catching you, the changes you made to their set will be permanent. One round has
                    passed when the player that was rolling the die when you made the change is playing again after
                    everyone else got their turn.
                    If you catch someone cheating and can prove to everyone they were actually cheating, that person is
                    obligated to give you 1 chip. If you accuse someone but cannot prove it, you must give 1 chip to the
                    person you accused. This does not apply to players that have already lost.</p>
